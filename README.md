# uMFD: A small button pad for Pico

This is in a really rough state lol. But it lets me use my pico as a simple
20 button gamepad for flight sims.

Probably will build this out a lil bit more? Eventually? This works though.

## Building

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cmake -B build`
3. `make -C build`
4. "Where is the final image?"
5. `find -name '*.uf2'`
